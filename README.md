# GoogleHashCode2019
Code from the Google Hash Code competition in 2019

4 hours with a team of 3. My first time participating in a coding competition, and it was a lot of fun! I learned a lot! We went with Python so we could put a solution together quickly. This was a good choice, but none of us have extensive expreience with it and it was my first time working with Python. We had a lot of pseduo code on paper that we didn't quite know how to implement-- in hindsight maybe we should have started coding sooner so we could at least have an output file instead of spending so much time on algorithm design. Still I think we did pretty well all things considered and we came pretty close to having an output file.
